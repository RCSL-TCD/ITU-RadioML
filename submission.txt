# Path to .pth checkpoint within this zipfile:
-> trainedmodel/

# Link to GitHub repository containing your code 
# (to be made public after submission deadline):
-> github.com/RCL-TCD/ITU-RadioML.git

# Instructions for reproduction:
-> On Miniconda
--> assuming docker environment setup inside "/home/user/Documents/RadioML"
--> conda activate 'environment' (conda create environment python=3.8 pip --file requirements.txt}
--> dataset_path = "/home/user/Documents/RadioML/GOLD_XYZ_OSC.0001_1024.hdf5" is the radioml dataset
--> place python file at the base folder of the environment (i.e., "/home/user/Documents/RadioML"
--> python radioml_final.py

-> On provided docker environment
--> Use the final_submission_model.ipynb
 

# Further comments:
-> Tested in miniconda environment with the requirements installed as defined for the radioml-challenge docker - Manjaro Linux w/ GPU acceleration (Restrictions on installing docker at work machines) - requirements.txt attached for environment details.
-> Validated in Ubuntu w/o GPU acceleration using provided docker environment
-> submitted files are ones generated via miniconda docker.
